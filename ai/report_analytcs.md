**Report and Analytics**
To truly measure the financial health of a hospitality enterprise (hotels, resorts, restaurants, etc.), you must track a comprehensive set of metrics that address four core areas: Operational Performance, Profitability, Liquidity & Solvency, and Efficiency.

Below is a breakdown of the key metrics, including hospitality-specific indicators and general financial ratios:

1. Operational Performance (Revenue & Core Activity)
These metrics assess how effectively the core hospitality assets (rooms, seats, services) are being utilized to generate revenue.

Metric,Calculation (Example for Hotels),Why it Matters
Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR),Total Room Revenue/Total Available Rooms OR ADR×Occupancy Rate,"The single most important measure of room revenue generation, combining both pricing (ADR) and utilization (Occupancy)."
Occupancy Rate,(Total Rooms Sold/Total Available Rooms)×100,Measures the demand for your property's rooms/inventory.
Average Daily Rate (ADR),Total Room Revenue/Total Rooms Sold,"Measures the average price achieved per room, reflecting pricing strategy."
Total Revenue Per Available Room (TRevPAR),Total Hotel Revenue/Total Available Rooms,"A broader measure that includes all revenue streams (F&B, spa, etc.) per available room."
Average Check / Average Spend Per Customer,Total Sales/Total Customers/Covers,"Crucial for restaurants and F&B operations, indicating the average value of a sale."
Revenue Per Available Seat Hour (RevPASH),Total Outlet Revenue/(Available Seats×Operating Hours),A key metric for F&B operations to measure efficiency of seating capacity over time.

2. Profitability Metrics
These metrics assess the enterprise's ability to turn revenue into profit after accounting for costs.

Metric,Calculation,Why it Matters
Gross Operating Profit Per Available Room (GOPPAR),Gross Operating Profit (GOP)/Total Available Rooms,"Measures profitability on a per-room basis before non-operating expenses (like rent, interest, taxes, depreciation). It reflects operational management efficiency."
EBITDA / GOP Margin,(EBITDA/Total Revenue)×100 OR (GOP/Total Revenue)×100,"EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is a key measure of core operating financial performance, often used for valuation and comparing against competitors."
Net Profit Margin,(Net Income/Total Revenue)×100,"The ultimate ""bottom line,"" showing the percentage of total revenue that results in net profit after all expenses, including taxes and interest."
Gross Profit Margin,(Revenue−Cost of Goods Sold)/Revenue,"Particularly important for F&B, indicating the profitability of sales after direct production costs."
Return on Assets (ROA),Net Income/Total Assets,"Measures how efficiently the enterprise is using its assets (e.g., building, equipment) to generate profit."
Return on Equity (ROE),Net Income/Shareholders’ Equity,Measures the return generated on the owners' investment.

3. Cost & Efficiency Ratios
These ratios highlight cost control and how efficiently resources are being managed, which is critical in an industry with high fixed and variable costs.

Metric,Calculation,Why it Matters
Labor Cost Percentage,(Total Labor Costs/Total Revenue)×100,"Labor is a major expense; this ratio tracks its proportion of total sales, revealing staffing efficiency."
Food/Beverage Cost Percentage,(Cost of Food/Beverage Sold/Food/Beverage Revenue)×100,"The primary control metric for F&B, indicating ingredient cost management."
Cost Per Occupied Room (CPOR),Total Operational Costs of Rooms/Total Rooms Sold,"Measures the variable cost of servicing an occupied room (e.g., utilities, housekeeping supplies)."
Prime Cost (F&B),Cost of Goods Sold+Total Labor Costs,The two largest controllable expenses in a restaurant; keeping this low is vital for F&B profitability.
Inventory Turnover,Cost of Goods Sold/Average Inventory Value,"Measures how quickly inventory is sold and replaced, indicating efficiency and minimizing waste/spoilage."

4. Liquidity & Solvency (Financial Stability)
These ratios assess the enterprise's ability to meet its short-term and long-term financial obligations.

Metric,Calculation,Why it Matters
Current Ratio,Current Assets/Current Liabilities,"A measure of short-term liquidity. A ratio between 1.2 and 2.0 is generally considered healthy, meaning the enterprise can cover its short-term debts."
Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio),(Current Assets−Inventory)/Current Liabilities,"A stricter measure of liquidity, showing ability to pay short-term debt without relying on selling inventory (which can be difficult in a crunch)."
Debt-to-Equity Ratio,Total Debt/Shareholders’ Equity,"A measure of solvency and leverage, showing the proportion of debt used to finance assets relative to equity. A lower ratio indicates lower financial risk."
Interest Coverage Ratio,EBIT/Interest Expense,Measures the ability to cover interest payments on outstanding debt. A higher ratio indicates better health.
Cash Flow from Operations,(Found on the Cash Flow Statement),Measures the actual cash generated by the core business activities. Positive cash flow is paramount for survival.
